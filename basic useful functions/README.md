In this file you can find functions to:
1) Get the phonological LPC form of a word or a whole sentence
2) Get the number of LPC gestures of a word or a whole sentence
3) Get the LPC code for a word per gesture

At the beginning of the notebook you have the instruction how to call those functions in order to use them in other notebooks.
